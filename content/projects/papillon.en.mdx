[Papillon](https://papillon.bzh/) is an **open-source client** for school life management software (like [Pronote](https://www.index-education.com/fr/logiciel-gestion-vie-scolaire.php), [ÉcoleDirecte](https://www.aplim.fr/EcoleDirecte), [Scodoc](https://scodoc.org/), etc.). Its goal is to allow users to connect to their school accounts and access their data through an intuitive and enjoyable interface.

Today, it has over 1,500,000 users, 4 years of adventure, and 8 versions. It has become **a reference** among alternative school life clients. But how did we get here?

## From a simple question
It all started from a question I asked myself in 10th grade: "Why can't I freely access my grades and homework?"

It seems trivial, but even today, almost all our data is locked into platforms that limit what we can do with information that concerns us, all in an interface that doesn't really seem designed for us.

So, I started thinking. How could we do better?

<sup>First UX research for Papillon</sup>

I was still in high school, and I had no idea how to do this. So I Started researching how to design a mobile application, from design to deployment. But if one thing was clear from the beginning, it's that Papillon would be **open-source**.

And that changed everything.

## The result
During all this time, we've continuously improved the application, whether in terms of design, stability, or features.

<sup>First UX research for Papillon</sup>

And it works! In December 2024, Papillon was France's most downloaded app for a week, bringing us nearly 500,000 downloads, thanks to a TikTok trend.

Then many media outlets followed, such as:
- [Ouest-France](https://www.ouest-france.fr/bretagne/lannion-22300/lappli-de-cet-etudiant-des-cotes-darmor-compte-des-milliers-dutilisateurs-5de4c720-84ab-11ef-91d9-7f562215fe95)
- [France 3 Bretagne](https://france3-regions.franceinfo.fr/bretagne/cotes-d-armor/lannion/pronote-c-est-pas-super-papillon-la-nouvelle-application-qui-veut-faciliter-le-suivi-scolaire-des-lyceens-3079267.html) (also [on regional TV news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVXPoDn1UJQ))
- [BFM TV](https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/vie-numerique/maintenant-on-va-etre-heureux-c-est-quoi-papillon-l-application-qui-ameliore-enfin-pronote_AV-202412170727.html)

And all of this led to the community writing the [Wikipedia article](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillon_(application)), detailing how the project works.

## Open-source software

Open-source software is an approach based on a simple observation: **everyone** can use, modify, share, distribute, and appropriate a tool. What may seem crazy is actually the project's greatest strength.
- More than 100 contributors have participated over time
- Highly skilled developers and designers have contributed to making it even better
- Users are guaranteed to be free with their data
- The code is open to all, **which paves the way for a community** focused on sharing and continuous improvement

And thanks to the exposure that the open-source community gave to the project, I was able to **build a team**: [the Papillon team](https://papillon.bzh/association).

By the way, we organize an annual keynote presenting our work:
