As part of my studies, I was tasked to develop an interactive device in a duo for the IUT de Lannion open house day. The objective was to allow visitors to discover the MMI program and the disciplines taught within it.

## The device

Compose ton Logo is a simple way to try graphic design. Using a kiosk, visitors can create their logo using simplified controls inspired by software like Figma or Illustrator.

It was created in a group with [Roxane Omnes](https://www.instagram.com/artheia._/), who handled UX research and visual design.

## The interface
Using [React.js](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Electron Vite](https://electron-vite.org/) and [Framer Motion](https://motion.dev/), I developed an interactive interface based on designs from UX research.

Through the project development, I learned many things, particularly about developing kiosk-style interfaces and developing advanced animations for dynamic interfaces.

## An immersive and playful universe

To make the experience memorable for high school students, the device isn't limited to a simple software interface. We set up an immersive universe including complete physical wrapping of the touch kiosk, animations and integrated sound design. The physical installation consists of:
- A 55" Ilyama touch table on a mobile stand, controlled by a desktop computer.
- Custom wrapping consisting of three printed banners (front, left and right faces) attached by velcro.
- A wall projection located 1 meter from the table, displaying a dynamic fresco of logos created by previous visitors.

## A visual identity

To highlight the project, a visual identity inspired by retro styles was put in place, with motion design mixing 2D and 3D used as intro.

## The user journey
The experience was designed to be intuitive and accessible. The path breaks down into three key steps:
- Arrival: A standby screen invites the user to "Create my logo" while the projector displays the gallery of existing creations.
- Composition: The user enters their text (protected by a censorship module) then progresses through tabs to customize shapes and colors.
- Finalization: Once creation is complete, the visitor can choose to receive their logo by email in .png format or send it to the video projector to add it to the collective gallery.

## The installer experience
To allow the device to be reusable, detailed documentation was produced to allow the installer to set up the device.

## Conclusion
The project concluded with the delivery of a functional and coherent device, perfectly faithful to the client's expectations for the March 7, 2026 open house. Thanks to the complementarity of our skills in graphic design and web development, we succeeded in transforming an abstract idea into an immersive, playful and intuitive physical experience.
